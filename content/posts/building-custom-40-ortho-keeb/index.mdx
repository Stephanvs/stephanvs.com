Since a while now I've had an interest in custom build keyboards. The idea of building one myself really intrigued me, where I could choose every detail exactly how I like it.

So first things first. Why do all this? Why invest all this time into building a keyboard while there are obviously so many options available. The answer in my mind is pretty simple. It is my job to type letters on a keyboard. I spend a lot of time doing this almost every day. At this time typing letters on a keyboard is also the _only_ way to do my job (programming). Also the keyboard I use to type on is the primary interface between my hands (or my brain by extension) and the computer that executes these thoughts.

In addition to these custom keyboards there are a couple of vague ideas that I had heard other people talk about. One of these was vim, and even though I kind of knew that could make me more productive. I'd never really taken the time to check out what all the ~~fuss~~ hype, was really about.

When I orignally learned there are keyboards different than the default ISO 104 en_US keyboard, and in this case I'm talking about really different keyboards such as TKL, ortholinear, split kb's I became interested and decided now might be a good time to investigate some of these claims that I heard other people so positive about.

# Ortholinear vs. Staggered layout

So diving in I found out that the core idea behind a ortholinear keyboard is the placement of the keys. This becomes obvious the moment you see an ortho keyboard and a more conventional style such as a staggered layout. what you're probably more familiar with.
