Since a while now I've had an interest in custom build keyboards. The idea of building one myself really intrigued me, where I could choose every detail exactly how I like it.

So first things first. Why do all this? Why invest all this time into building a keyboard while there are obviously so many options available. The answer in my mind is pretty simple. My job is to type letters on a keyboard. I really like doing this job. This means that I spend a lot of time on my computer and the keyboard I use to type on is my primary interface between my hands (or my mind in extension) and the OS.

There are a couple of vague ideas that I had heard other people talk about, such as vim, and even though I kind of knew that could make you more productive. I'd never really taken the time to check out what all the 'fuss' was really about.

When I learned there are keyboards different than the default ISO 104 en_US keyboard, and in this case I'm talking about really different keyboards such as TKL, ortholinear, split kb's I became interested and decided now might be a good time to investigate some of these claims that I heard.

So diving in I found out that the core idea behind a ortholinear keyboard is the placement of the keys. This becomes obvious the moment you compare an ortho keyboard and a more conventional style such as a staggered layout what you're probably more familiar with.
