I'm an independent software architect & developer. I focus on building backend systems with highly scalable and distributed characteristics.

I like to experiment with different programming languages and learn from different paradigms such as imperative and functional. My main proficiency is in C# and .NET and I enjoy using other languages such as Go, F# and Rust even some Elixir from time to time.

When I'm not working, I like to have a fun time with my kids. I really enjoy travelling the world and experiencing new cultures. As of lately I'm also discovering the joys of flying with Microsoft Flight Simulator, and for that I'm building a miniature cockpit, at least with Honeycomb Yoke, Bravo and my own programmed flightdeck on Loupedeck.
